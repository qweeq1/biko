            </ul>


            <p>4. YOUR RIGHTS</p>
            <p>By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. Further information and advice
                about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country:</p>

            <ul class="dot_list">
                <li>The right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily
                    understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we are
                    providing you with the information in this Policy.
                </li>
                <li>The right of access. You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we are processing
                    it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you
                    are aware and can check that we are using your information in accordance with data protection law.
                    You can do this by writing to us on the email address below.
                </li>
                <li>The right to rectification. You are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate
                    or incomplete. You can do this through your account page or by contacting us at the email address
                    below.
                </li>
                <li>The right to erasure. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms,
                    enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling
                    reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
                </li>
                <li>The right to restrict processing. You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your
                    information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it
                    further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’
                    to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
                </li>
                <li>The right to data portability. You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own
                    purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this
                    enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs
                    safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
                </li>
                <li>The right to object to processing. You have the right to object to certain types of processing,
                    including processing for direct marketing (i.e., if you no longer want to be contacted with
                    potential opportunities).
                </li>
                <li>The right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or
                    process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.
                </li>
                <li>The right to withdraw consent. If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal
                    data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not
                    mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is
                    unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing
                    purposes. You can do this by any of the following means:

                    <ul class="dot_list">
                        <li>Send us an e-mail at https://bikotrading.com</li>
                        <li>Unsubscribe from our marketing email communications at any time by unsubscribing or
                            following the instructions contained within the email.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to
                cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:</p>

            <ul class="dot_list">
                <li>baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or</li>
                <li>further copies of the same information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.</p>

            <p>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond as soon as we can.
                Generally, this will be within one (1) month from when we receive your request but, if the request is
                going to take longer to deal with, we will come back to you and let you know.</p>

            <p>We do not direct the BikoTrading Academy Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal

                provided personal information through the BikoTrading Academy Services, we will use reasonable efforts
                to remove such information from our files.</p>


            <p>6. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>

            <p>We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information. However, no
                electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note
                that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You use the
                BikoTrading Academy Services and provide us with your information at your own risk. If we share
                information with a third party we shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that they keep the
                information secure and only use the information consistent with the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
